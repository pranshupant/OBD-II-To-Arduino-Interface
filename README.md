# OBD-II-To-Arduino-Interface
This code can be utilized to communicate to an OBD-II scanning tool used in cars and bikes to determine ECU and sensor values.
This code can be used to communicate with OBD-II via bluetooth or manually through the Rx and Tx pins of the module. Software serial module is used for bluetooth while Serial should be used for wired connection. This particular code communicates with an LCD screen.

Establishes interface b/w OBD_II, wheelspeed sensors, Gear Position sensor and the Display LCD using Arduino as a mediator
